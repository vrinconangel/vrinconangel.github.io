    <h1>"Sowftware is Hard"</h1>
        <p> Summary: In the article, Software Is Hard by Kyle Wilson we get a glimpse into the world of 
            software projects and the difficulties that come along with them. following the Chandler's
            projects path to their initial release. Wilson touches on some reasons why the Project was...
            intensive. some of these points include the ambisions of peer-to-peer applications and 
            cross-platform compatability complicated the communication and securtity requirements. 
            Wilson continues to another main point which is that code cant me numerically measured.
            there are so many uncertinties in a single line of code that it cant be measured. 
            throught out the article Wilson included several insightful quotes that enbody the 
            difficulties of programming. one of the ones that stand out the most are, "The hardest 
            single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build" said by 
            Fred Brooks and "Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions 
            of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute 
            force and thousands of slaves." said by Alan Kay. The main focus of this article is to show the 
            the reader why software programming is "hard" and Wilson does a good job of this by including 
            several examples including the Chandler project.
