    <h1>"Sowftware is Hard"</h1>
        <p> Summary: In the article, Software Is Hard by Kyle Wilson we get a glimpse into the world of 
            software projects and the difficulties that come along with them. following the Chandler's
            projects path to their initial release. Wilson touches on some reasons why the Project was...
            intensive. some of these points include the ambisions of peer-to-peer applications and 
            cross-platform compatability complicated the communication and securtity requirements. 
            Wilson continues to another main point which is that code cant me numerically measured.
            there are so many uncertinties in a single line of code that it cant be measured. 
            throught out the article Wilson included several insightful quotes that enbody the 
            difficulties of programming. one of the ones that stand out the most are, "The hardest 
            single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build" said by 
            Fred Brooks and "Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions 
            of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute 
            force and thousands of slaves." said by Alan Kay. The main focus of this article is to show the 
            the reader why software programming is "hard" and Wilson does a good job of this by including 
            several examples including the Chandler project.

    <h1>"DevOps for the hybrid cloud"</h1>
        <p> In this article IBM introduces us to the idea and implementation process of DevOps. the article
            begins by explaining the new era of development and oporations and just how essential it is 
            for a company to integrate DevOps and cloud into their IT startegy. folowing this intoduction 
            IBM share with us their point of view on DevOps. their first point; Adoption is expanding. 
            into larger orginiations implamenting cloud. next, Hybrid is becoming the norm and this provides
            flexability in deployment. additionally, solutions vary by teams as different orginizations have 
            different goal, orginization, cultures and tools. IBM also belives that app security is essential 
            and should be integrated early and throughout the DevOps lifecycle. And finally continuos delivery
            is the desired outcome with the DevOps application.
        </p>
        <p> In the second part of this article IBM claims that the change in bussiness is driven by anylitics 
            mobile and social technologies and is unpreccedented in speed and scope. the needs of customers 
            constantly evolve. they give great examples of this including Uber, Spotify and other "born on the web"
            companys. IBM states that a company must innovate and adapt in order to keep up with all the consumers
            demands and they belive cloud is the best platform for software delivery. it allows for fater time to 
            feedback from customers and the ability to monitor shifts in the market is key. all this change and 
            all the frequent releases needs tighter collaberation betwrrn bussiness, development and IT opperations.
            and this is where DevOps come into play. DevOps has three main objectives. First, to speed continous 
            innovation of ideas through collaberation development. second, to enable continous delivery of innovation
            by automating the software delivery process while eliminating waste. And third, to provide a feedback 
            loop for continous learning from customers. all together the process of integrating DevOps follows these 
            steps; Think, Code, Deliver, Run, Manage and learn.

    <h1>"Big Ball of Mud"</h1>
        <p> in the article Big Ball of Mud scott Rosenburg talks about why software is viewed as a big ball of mud. 
            The first point he makes is that software is the way it is because it simple works. he satates that while these 
            balls of mud may be difficult to understand and smake life more difficult for programers they arent nessesarily 
            a mistake. He quotes not every backyard storage shack needs marble shelves. Rosenburg goes on to say that a 
            "big ball of mud" produced on time is preferable over a well structured shiny product that may take years longer to complete. 
            producing a product on time allows for user feedback he claims and this is very valuable when creating a product.
